        <h2>Hello, welcome to my portfolio</h2>

        <h2>My hobbies:</h2>
        <p>I have played Magic, the Gathering for the while and have a pretty big collection. I play the Commander format with my friends often, and red is by far my favorite color in the game</p>
        <p>I also enjoy tabletop gaming. I have played Dungeons and Dragons with my friends and am working on a Warhammer 40k army as a quaratine project</p>
        <p>Finally, I spend a lot of time painting miniatures for tabletop gaming. Eveything looks better on the table with a nice coat of paint on it</p>
        <p>Make sure to check out my About page and my Portfolio to see what projects I've been doing</p>
